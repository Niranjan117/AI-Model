DISCLAIMER:

This software is designed for research and educational purposes. While we strive
for accuracy, the predictions and analyses provided by this system should not be
used as the sole basis for agricultural or financial decisions. Users should
consult with agricultural experts and consider multiple data sources when making
important decisions.

The accuracy of predictions depends on various factors including:
- Quality and resolution of input satellite imagery
- Weather data accuracy and availability
- Regional agricultural practices and conditions
- Seasonal variations and climate patterns

RESEARCH ETHICS:

This project is committed to:
- Open source development and transparency
- Responsible AI practices
- Environmental sustainability
- Supporting global food security research
- Ethical use of satellite and weather data
